# 20 Years of Games Data Visualisation.

## Overview:

The Charts visualised 20 years of games released per platform (Title and Genre). The data used shows 20 years of games released with different informations but the project was limited to charting;
* number of realeases per game platform in 20 years (Title),
* editors choice over 20 years
* score phrase over 20 years
* average score / genre chart over 20 years and
* number of realeases per game platform in 20 years (genre)

## UX:

The chart dash board has been designed to visually show the relationship between the data under use. A user can easily see number of releases of a PC Game in 20 years from the title chart or number of editors choices in 20 years. The layout was planned using balsamiq wireframing uploaded in images folder and on this [link](https://balsamiq.cloud/st8pqbr/pxhm6jv/r2278) for a limited time. Users can easy manouver around the site via different types of mobile devices and desktop .
